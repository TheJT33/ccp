# Introducing the Colored Conventions Project Team

The award-winning Colored Conventions Project core team is comprised of a diverse group of dedicated and energetic scholars, graduate student leaders, librarians, and undergraduate researchers at the University of Delaware. Project members represent a wide range of academic disciplines from English and history to computer science and German. Augmented by our North American Teaching Partners, our interdisciplinary team is committed to generating an online hub that "brings buried African American history to digital life" and attends to social justice activism in scholarship and research by offering an opportunity for deep engagement with 19th-century Black political organizing. This work has been recognized by awards from the MLA, ASA, and PCA/ACA along with grants from the NEH, Mellon Foundation, and CLIR. Meet the team! Then see the video about the Colored Conventions Project and learn more about project committees and our project principles.
