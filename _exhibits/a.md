# Parham's Reply:
## Cincinnati Convention


{% include parallax_image.html collection='ccp' pid='cin_cle' y='50%' %}


There was a national colored convention in Cincinnati in 1891 and 1893, however this references a National Colored Convention occurring in Cincinnati in July 4-5 of 1892.  The writer of this article says that the convention is being called for the goal of raising $100,000 to help “suffering emigrants.”  However, the writer is skeptical this will succeed for several reasons, which boil down essentially to: one, conventions are more about performance and spectacle than actual progress two, the people who go to the convention tend not to be charitable, and three, no amount of money can buy justice for the emigrants living in the South.  A lot of the article is focused on personal attacks or the refutation of such attacks.
